# 4443Project (Automated and benchmark unit tests for a basic Painting App)

Automated and benchmark unit tests for a simple painting app that we made in android studio for a group research project. 
The app's code is based on some tutorials online as most of my group mates are not experienced in developing android apps nor coding in java. 
so by using tutorial as the base for our app, it would help group to be able to code the project as they can just follow the tutorial step by step and the app would completed. (or so I thought)

Most of the group went missing for like a month without communicating to me and my other group mate
and after that, they didn't take initative nor commit to the coding work that they say they would (i have the history logs for both the code)

so, i had to take intaiitive and do the whole thing by myself, otherwise, we would literally get a 0 for this. The import of the colorpicker package didn't work (cuz the address for the import is dead), 
so I just copied all its code from the github and added in the files that it needs to run. (and other things as well but can't remember)
