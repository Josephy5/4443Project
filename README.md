# 4443Project (Basic Painting App)

A simple painting that we made in android studio for a group research project. 
It is based on some tutorials as most of my group mates are not experienced in developing android apps nor coding in java. 

Also, they went missing for like a month without communicating to me and my other group mate
and they didn't take initative nor commit to the coding work that they say they would (i have the history logs for both the code)

so, i had to take intaiitive and do the whole thing by myself, otherwise, we would literally get a 0 for this (I am not joking, thats how bad the situation got)
